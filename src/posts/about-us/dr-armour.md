Dr. Micki Armour grew up in the Washington DC area and attended Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland.  After attending Colby College, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s School Of Veterinary Medicine. She then completed an internship and a three-year residency, after which she became a board certified Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Ophthamologists. Dr. Armour and her wonderful husband Phil have 3 sons, Brayden, Finn and Eric. She enjoys running, skiing, ice skating (go caps!) and being active with the boys.  Her first-born "children" Brody (a black lab) and Sam (a boxer) have been with her through her internship and residency, and love to hike in Great Falls park.

## Ophthalmology

I grew up in the Washington DC area and attended Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland. When I was growing up in the area, my own pets were patients at Friendship Hospital for Animals.  My husband Phil and I have 3 sons, Brayden, Finn and Eric. I enjoy running, skiing, ice hockey (go Caps!) and being active with the boys. My first-born "children" Brody (a black lab) and Sam (a boxer) love to hike in Great Falls park.  

## Clinical Areas of Interest
I enjoy offering the gold standard of medical and surgical care for ophthalmic diseases in our pets. In particular, I enjoy collaboration with human ophthalmologists in the field of corneal diseases, glaucoma and cataracts.

My team focuses on exceptional quality while providing the highest standards of patient care and client communication. I offer specialty services including phacoemulsification for cataracts, endocyclophotocoagulation for glaucoma, medical management of chronic dry eye and revolutionizing corneal disease therapy. 
I am so excited to join the innovative team at Friendship Hospital for Animals.
