Your pet is considered a candidate for cataract surgery in one eye or in both eyes.  Cataract surgery is performed with the patient on his back, under general anesthesia with an operating microscope. **Please alert the ophthalmology team if your pet has spinal cord or neurologic concerns prior to surgery.** Prior to surgery, bloodwork including a complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemical profile is recommended (must be performed within 3 months of the date of the procedure).  Other bloodwork samples or diagnostic workup steps may be required prior to surgery based on your pets history.

Typically patients are admitted for cataract surgery around 8am.
* **If your pet is not a diabetic**, please withhold food after midnight the day prior to surgery.

* **If your pet is a diabetic**, I recommend feeding ½ the amount of food and administering ½ the insulin dose the morning of the procedure.  If your pet is a diabetic, he or she is predisposed to systolic hypotension, and I recommend maintaining him/her on intravenous fluid therapy before, during and after the procedure.  We will also be monitoring blood sugar levels (glucose) before, during and after surgery.

I recommend grooming your pet (with a close groom around the eyes) prior to the day of surgery.

Many patients can benefit from spending the night after cataract surgery with the emergency overnight service at Friendship Hospital for Animals.  Some of the important parameters that are monitored include intraocular pressures (as many pets can get short-term postoperative ocular hypertension) and blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. *Please be sure to bring all eye drops, oral medications, and food with you the morning of surgery.*

Your pet will be on oral medications and eye drops for several weeks following his or her procedure. These medications will be slowly tapered but are critical to surgical success.  If you do not think that you can administer oral or topical medications following surgery to your pet, cataract surgery should not be elected. *Also, please let us know if your pet has any allergies to medications.*
